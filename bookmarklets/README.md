# Bookmarklets collection

## General Info
    * How to add Boomarklets
        * Drag the "Drag me to your bookmarks bar" to your bookmark bar. Alternatively click the bookmark button (star), a box will pop up and click more. Where it says URL, copy and paste the bookmarklet code. Then click save and your bookmarklet should appear with other bookmarks.
    * Blocked Bookmarklets
        * If a bookmarklet is blocked when you click on the bookmarklet a little shield with a X on it will appear next to the bookmark button. Click on that shield and it will tell you that the page is trying to load "Scripts from unathenticated sources." You click on load unsafe scripts and then the page will refresh. You then click on the bookmarklet again and it should load.
    * Sources
        * I have created none of these bookmarklets. The names I have listed them as may not be their original names. I will not site the original authors.
